# Simple Patch Finder

Live demo: https://ceddc.github.io/simple-patch-finder/

Single-page patch finder for ArcGIS/Esri patches.

- Fast patch list
- Practical filters
- Shareable filtered URLs
- Custom version ordering
- Direct links to the official Esri patch pages

This project is intentionally buildless (one `index.html`) and uses CDN-loaded dependencies:
- Calcite Design System (primary UI) - docs: https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/ - repo: https://github.com/Esri/calcite-design-system
- Tabulator (table/grid UI, sorting, local pagination) - repo: https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator

Implementation notes:

- Single JS file: `js/app.js`
- Calcite-first UI (web components)
- No external JavaScript APIs beyond the table/grid library

## Vibe-coded note

This project was vibe-coded with OpenCode and Codex 5.3 at basically "level 0". I did not read much code upfront; I mostly guided the agent and pointed at specific changes.

Could I have coded it myself? Probably. But it would have taken longer with no clear idea upfront of how long, and I have little interest in coding tables, filters, and JSON parsing. It is not the kind of coding I find fun. Even after thinking about this for months, I likely would never have started.

## Quick start

1) Download the patches dataset next to the HTML:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://downloads.esri.com/patch_notification/patches.json" -o patches.json
```

Note: `patches.meta.json` is normally created by GitHub Actions. If it's missing locally, the app still loads but won't show the dataset "Updated" timestamp.

2) Serve locally (required for `fetch()` to work):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

3) Open:

- http://localhost:8000/

## How it works

- The UI is a static page (`index.html`) that loads `./patches.json`.
- The site also loads `./patches.meta.json` to show when the dataset was last refreshed.
- The dataset is published by Esri at `https://downloads.esri.com/patch_notification/patches.json`.

## Dataset files

This app reads two local files:

- `patches.json`: the upstream dataset content.
- `patches.meta.json`: small metadata generated by GitHub Actions so the UI can display when the dataset was last refreshed.

`patches.meta.json` includes:

- `source_url`: the upstream URL used by the workflow
- `updated_at_utc`: when the workflow ran (UTC)
- `patches_sha256`: SHA-256 of `patches.json`
- `bytes`: size of `patches.json` in bytes

## Repo layout

- `index.html` - static shell + metadata
- `css/app.css` - app styling
- `js/app.js` - app logic (no build step)

## About

The goal is speed: find a patch quickly and jump to the official Esri page for full details and downloads.

## Links

- Official website: https://support.esri.com/
- Feedback/issues: https://github.com/ceddc/simple-patch-finder

## GitHub Pages

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that downloads and commits the latest dataset every 30 minutes (UTC) to `main`:

- `patches.json` (upstream content)
- `patches.meta.json` (refresh timestamp + hash)
- `sitemap.xml` (sitemap index)
- `sitemap-pages.xml` (homepage + product URLs)
- `sitemap-patches.xml` (patch deep-link URLs)

Schedule: `HH:12` and `HH:42` (UTC). You can also run it manually from the Actions tab.

To publish the site:

- GitHub repo settings: Pages
- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: `main`
- Folder: `/ (root)`

## Repo notes

- The dataset is refreshed by GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/update-dataset.yml`).
- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are included for SEO.
- The update workflow generates `sitemap.xml`, `sitemap-pages.xml`, and `sitemap-patches.xml` from `patches.json`.
